Without prejudice to any other rights and remedies to which the Principal may be entitled under this Agreement, the Principal may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without notice and without any liability to make any further payment to the Contractor (other than in respect of amounts accrued before the date of such termination) if at any time: \n\n4.2.1 the Contractor commits any serious or repeated breach or non-observance of any of the provisions of this agreement or refuses or neglects to comply with any reasonable and lawful directions of the Principal; \n\n4.2.2 the Contractor is convicted of any criminal offence (other than an offence under any road traffic legislation for which a fine or non-custodial penalty is imposed); 4.2.3 the Contractor is in the reasonable opinion of the Principal negligent or incompetent in the performance of the Services; \n\n4.2.4 the Contractor becomes bankrupt or makes a voluntary arrangement with his or her creditors; \n\n4.2.5 the Contractor commits any fraud or dishonesty or acts in any manner which in the opinion of the Principal brings or is capable of bringing the Contractor or the Principal into disrepute or is materially adverse to the interests of the Principal; \n\n4.2.6 the Contractor commits any serious breach of the Principal’s policies and procedures; or \n\n4.2.8 The Contractor wilfully or negligently introduces a virus or other harmful code to the Contractor’s or the Principal’s hardware or software used in the performance of the Services. \n\n4.3. At any time during this Agreement and, in any event, upon termination of this Agreement, for whatever reason: \n\n4.3.1 the Principal will be entitled to a copy of all work carried out or completed by the Contractor in the performance of the Services under this Agreement in the form in which it exists at the time; and \n\n4.3.2 The Contractor will return to the Principal all equipment, documentation or other property in the Contractor’s possession or under his control belonging to the Principal. \n\n4.4. The Principal may, with the agreement of the Contractor, extend the terms of the Agreement for a period agreed between the parties. \n\n5. Intellectual Property \n\n5.1. All rights, title and interest of whatever nature (including but not limited to copyright, designs and patent application rights) in any work undertaken or material produced by the Contractor in the course of the Services (the “Project Materials”) will vest in and belong to the Principal at all times, and free from any interest of the Contractor, the Contractor Representative or any third party. The Contractor will do anything that the Principal may reasonably require in order to effectively vest such rights in the Principal or such third party as the Principal specifies or to evidence the same (whether before or after the termination of this Agreement). \n\n5.2. The Principal shall retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of whatever nature and, if registerable, whether registered or not, in the document or other material and data and other information provided to the Contractor in the context of this Agreement. \n\n5.3.

The Contractor warrants that Services provided are not in breach of the intellectual property rights of any other third party, and will indemnify the Principal against all and any actions, claims, costs, expenses, damages, demands and liabilities whatsoever and howsoever incurred resulting from or arising out of any claim by a third party that the use of or possession of any work performed by or delivered by the Contractor in connection with this Agreement infringes the intellectual property rights of that third party, save that this will not apply where the infringement results directly from the compliance with any specifications issued by the Principal. \n\n5.5 The Contractor hereby unconditionally, irrevocably and in perpetuity waives all moral rights and all rights of a similar nature under the laws of any jurisdiction in respect of the Project Materials. \n\n5.6 The provisions of this paragraph 5 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, howsoever arising. \n\n6. Force Majeure \n\n6.1. Neither party shall have any liability to the other for delay or loss occasioned by any circumstance which is outside that party’s reasonable control to prevent (including but not limited to war, industrial dispute, fire, explosion, natural disaster, death). \n\n7. Other Activities \n\n7.1. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Contractor from being engaged, concerned or having any financial interest in any capacity in any other business, trade, profession or occupation during the term of this Agreement and thereafter from the termination of this Agreement provided that such activity does not cause a breach of any of the Contractor's obligations under this Agreement (and in particular the obligations under clause 8). \n\n8. Confidentiality \n\n8.1 The term 'Confidential Information' shall mean any and all materials and information, disclosed by or otherwise obtained from the Principal or any third party as a result of this Agreement, whether written or oral, including, but not limited to: \n\n8.1.1 technical, financial, commercial or other information which relates to the business, financial affairs, methods of operation or proposed methods of operation, accounts, transactions or products, proposed transactions or proposed products, security procedures, trade secrets, know-how, inventions, internal controls or computer or data processing programs, algorithms, electronic data processing applications, routines, subroutines, techniques or systems of the Principal or of any third party or their affiliates, customers, clients, agents, subcontractors; \n\n8.1.2 information or data relating to the Principal or any third party’s systems, operations, policies, procedures, techniques, business plans, accounts or personnel; \n\n8.1.3 the identities and other related information of the Principal’s and any third party’s suppliers and clients; \n\n8.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, 'Confidential Information' shall not include any information that: \n\n8.2.1 becomes generally available to the public through no act or default on the part of the Contractor; \n\n8.2.2 was already available to the Contractor without restriction in relation to disclosure before the date of receipt of the Confidential Information from the Principal or any third party. \n\n8.3 The Contractor agrees: 8.3.1 to employ all reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure, including measures no less protective than those measures that it employs to protect its own information of a like nature; \n\n8.3.2 not to publish or disclose the fact that the Confidential Information has been made available or that it has entered into an arrangement regarding the subject matter hereof; \n\n8.3.3 to restrict internal access to the Confidential Information to those employees and non-employee consultants with a 'need to know', who are either subject to a non-disclosure policy established by the Principal as their employer or have executed a non-disclosure agreement reasonably designed to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; \n\n8.3.4 to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its employees, non- employee consultants or agents; \n\n8.3.5 that notwithstanding the return of any Confidential Information in accordance with this paragraph 8, it shall, and shall ensure that its employees, non- employee consultants and agents continue to hold in confidence all Confidential Information, which obligation shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement; \n\n8.3.6 that the Principal shall have the right to such injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent any use or disclosure of Confidential Information in any manner which has not been authorized by the Principal or any third party without the necessity of proving actual damages, in addition to, and independent of, any damages which the Principal or any third party shall have incurred as a result of the breach; and \n\n8.3.7 that upon request by the Principal at any time, the Contractor shall promptly either deliver all Confidential Information in tangible form then in its possession or under its control to the Principal or, if so directed by the Principal, confirm in writing to the Principal that all such Confidential Information has been destroyed. \n\n8.4 If the Contractor is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed that they shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Principal with prompt notice of such request(s) or obligation so that it may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. \n\n8.5 The obligations imposed by this paragraph 8 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement. \n\n9. Mutuality of Obligation \n\n9.1. Neither the Principal nor the Contractor is obliged to provide future work or services following completion of the Services or termination of this Agreement howsoever caused. \n\n10. Light Entrepreneurship \n\n10.1. This Agreement with the Principal is entered into by the Contractor as a light entrepreneur. For the avoidance of doubt, the Contractor is acting in connection with this Agreement as an independent consultant. The Contractor is not and will not be an employee or agent of the Principal and the Contractor assumes full responsibility for the Contractor’s acts and omissions. \n\n11. Indemnity \n\n11.1. The Contractor shall indemnify and keep indemnified the Principal, its directors, employees and agents against all and any actions, claims, costs, expenses, damages and liabilities whatsoever and howsoever incurred resulting or arising from any negligent, wrongful or unlawful act or omission of the Contractor. \n\n11.2 Without limitation to the foregoing the Contractor hereby undertakes to indemnify the Principal and to keep it indemnified against any damage, demand, loss, expense, claim, action, or liability arising out of any breach by the Contractor of this Agreement. \n\n12. Liability \n\n12.1. In no circumstances will either party be liable to the other for any indirect, special or consequential loss or damage arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. In particular, and without limitation to the aforegoing, neither party will be liable for any loss by the other of business, revenue, profits, anticipated savings and goodwill save where such loss arises as a result of a breach of this Agreement. \n\n12.2. Neither party excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury, to the extent only that the same arises as a result of its negligence or that of its employees, agents or authorised representatives. \n\n13.
